kai - Auto-complete plugin for Ninja-IDE
========================================

Simple auto-complete plugin that would suggest possible word completions
from the words in the current file/tab.

Right now, completions are case sensitive and are listed for 3 or more
characters words (both should be configurable settings in the near future).
